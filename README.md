Data semantics project repository: 7 sins diachronical analysis.
The aim of the work is to perform a diachronic analysis of the 7 deadly sins to find out how their meaning and use has changed from the 19th century to the 21st century.
Additionally, we tried implementing some comparison metrics for the embedding models we used.
